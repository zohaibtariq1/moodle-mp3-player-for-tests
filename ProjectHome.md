## Description ##

This is a Flash MP3 audio player developed for use in listening tests within learning management systems. It can be embedded, using the code provided, into web pages to provide listening materials for on-line tests where it is necessary or desirable to control the number of times that a learner can listen to an audio recording. By default, the audio automatically plays once only and shows no controls. The number of times that the audio plays, showing a play button and waiting for the MP3 file to download completely can be set by adding the optional parameters.
